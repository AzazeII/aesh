[[Standalone-Mode]]
= Standalone Mode

Standalone mode is when you only want to run one command and not have many commands defined in a CLI session.
Note that it is possible to have more than one command if you create xref:commands.adoc#Subcommand[sub-commands].

Let's get started with a simple example:
[source,java]
----
import org.aesh.AeshRuntimeRunner;
import org.aesh.command.Command;

public class RuntimeExample {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      AeshRuntimeRunner.builder() <1>
                       .command(MyCommand.class) <2>
                       .args(args) <3>
                       .execute(); <4>
  }
}
