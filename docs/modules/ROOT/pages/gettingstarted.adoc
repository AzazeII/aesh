include::attributes.adoc[]

To use Ã†sh you need to add it as a dependency to your project:

== Maven
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>{groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>{artifact}</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Gradle
----
  compile \'{grouId}:{artifact}:{version}\'
----

Now we need to write some command applications! 

If you want to write standalone (a single command) go to xref:standalone.adoc[Standalone Mode].
If you are more interested in writing an interactive CLI go to xref:cli.adoc[CLI Mode].
